This tool accompanies our paper (Böhm, Carduck-Eick, Graff, Harbring, Sprengholz, & Tilkes, 2019). In this paper, we compare several indices that aim to predict cooperation rates in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game studies by using different computations of the varying payoff parametrizations T, R, P, and S. We review N = 354 studies conducted between 1958 and 2017, each with a unique cooperation rate under a specific payoff parametrization, and compare the prediction of cooperation rates separately for each index. To account for the different sample sizes in the studies, we use weighted ordinary least squares regressions.

We find considerable heterogeneity in the indices’ predictive value depending on the features of the studies. This tool allows researchers to filter the sample of studies based on these features, i.e., group composition status (non students vs. students vs. mixed), group composition sex (male vs. female vs. mixed), repeated game (yes vs. no), communication between players allowed (yes vs. no), and incentivized experiment (yes vs. no). As a result, the tool will filter the analysis to the studies that match the selected filter criteria and compute the predictive value of the indices accordingly.
